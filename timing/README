illegal-test.py: 
	To run, type "./illegal-test.py [-n <integer>] [-s]"
	  where the -n(--number) option specifies the number of times to test
	  and -s(--suppress) supresses the libsafe output
	  ex: "./illegal-test.py -n 1000 -s" to test 1000 times with suppression

	Or type "./illegal-test.py --help" for more information
	
	This test requires 'thread' to exist in the directory above it.
	Use mk.sh in the directory above to create this file.
	This test returns the number of times libsafe has caught an illegal
	strcpy, the average times it to catch an illegal strcpy, the average
	time it takes to fail in catching an illegal strcpy, and the time
	difference (avg time to catch - avg time to not catch).

legal-test.py:

	  where the -n(--number) option specifies the number of times to test
	  ex: "./legal-test.py -n 100" to test 100 times

	Or type "./legal-test.py --help" for more information

	This script requires 'legal-test' to exist in the directory above it.
